Data in two or more dimensions is stored linearly, so places nearby in the data can be far in memory or on disk. This package offers functions that sort multi-dimensional data to make storage and retrieval more efficient.

```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("BijectiveHilbert")
julia> using BijectiveHilbert
julia> xy = zeros(Int, 8, 8)
julia> for y in 1:size(xy, 2)
           for x in 1:size(xy, 1)
               z = encode_hilbert(Simple2D(Int), [x, y])
               xy[x, y] = z
           end
       end
julia> X = zeros(Int, 2)
julia> decode_hilbert!(Simple2D(Int), X, xy[5, 7])
julia> X == [5, 7]
julia> xy

This function, called a [Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve), is used most often for geospatial work or database implementation but is equally appropriate for dealing with large TIFF files. It helps memory locality because the order of the z-coordinate tends to pick values that are near each other in space. It belongs to the class of space-filling, self-avoiding, simple, and self-similar (FASS) curves, which includes Peano curves, and Morton z-curves.

Included are several variations of the Hilbert curve.

* [`Simple2D`](@ref), shown above, two-dimensional. Doesn't need to know axis dimensions.
* [`GlobalGray`](@ref), an n-dimensional curve where all axis dimensions must be equal.
* [`SpaceGray`](@ref), an n-dimensional curve with a different path. All axis dimensions must be equal.
* [`Compact`](@ref), an n-dimensional curve the permits each axis to be a different size.
