This [Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) library encodes a multi-dimensional grid index into a single integer, such that nearby integers are nearby grid indices. See the [`Usage`](https://computingkitchen.com/BijectiveHilbert.jl/stable/usage/).

```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("BijectiveHilbert")
julia> using BijectiveHilbert
julia> xy_coordinates = zeros(Int, 8, 8)
julia> for y in 1:size(xy_coordinates, 2)
           for x in 1:size(xy_coordinates, 1)
               z = encode_hilbert(Simple2D(Int), [x, y])
               xy_coordinates[x, y] = z
           end
       end
julia> xy_coordinates

This function, called a [Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve), is used most often for geospatial work or database implementation but is equally appropriate for dealing with large TIFF files. It belongs to the class of space-filling, self-avoiding, simple, and self-similar (FASS) curves, which includes Peano curves, and Morton z-curves.

Included are several variations of the Hilbert curve. They are type-stable and thoroughly tested, including bug fixes to amend the published algorithms.

* [`Simple2D`](https://computingkitchen.com/BijectiveHilbert.jl/stable/simple2d/) encodes two-dimensional Cartesian indices. Fastest and easiest to use.
* [`SpaceGray`](https://computingkitchen.com/BijectiveHilbert.jl/stable/compact/) encodes multi-dimensional Cartesian indices that all have the same power-of-two extent. The fastest multi-dimensional version.
* [`GlobalGray`](https://computingkitchen.com/BijectiveHilbert.jl/stable/globalgray/) like SpaceGray but a different pattern.
* [`FaceContinuous`](https://computingkitchen.com/BijectiveHilbert.jl/stable/facecontinuous/) like SpaceGray and GlobalGray, but another pattern again.
