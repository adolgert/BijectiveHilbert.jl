If the sizes aren't powers of two or are uneven, then set the bits to cover the largest side, so (12 x 12 x 12 x 800) would be b=10, n=4 because 800  2^10. There is one algorithm that deals better with uneven sides. The Compact algorithm can pack bits together so that the resulting Hilbert index takes less storage space. This is usually used for database storage.
