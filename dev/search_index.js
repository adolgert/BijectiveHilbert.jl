It's used most often for geospatial work but is equally appropriate for dealing with large TIFF files. It helps memory locality because the order of the z-coordinate tends to pick values that are near each other in space. It belongs to the class of space-filling, self-avoiding, simple, and self-similar (FASS) curves, which includes Peano curves, and Morton z-curves.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This particular version of the function is easier to use than the traditional Hilbert curve because you don't have to tell the function how large the 2D array of coordinates is, or will eventually be. For a traditional Hilbert curve, the same value of z can refer to different values of (i, j).
